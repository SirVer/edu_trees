Educational Implementation of Tree Structures
=============================================

This is my repository for some Tree structure implementations in Python. This
should not be a deployment ready package, rather it should make the concepts
of various Trees clear. There is also a small series on my blog about this
package.

If you want to visualize the trees as well using the `plot()` function, you
will need to install pydot_::

   pip install pydot

.. _pydot: http://code.google.com/p/pydot/
